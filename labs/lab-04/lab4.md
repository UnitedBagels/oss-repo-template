### Why is it important to choose a license?

Choosing a license is important because it lets users know to what extent they are able to use, reproduce, and modify software. Additionally, certain licenses place restrictions for use in proprietary software; choosing a particular license ensures that your software is open source and contains the amount of restrictions that you prefer.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Without a license, your project is not truly open source. Even though anyone could view your code on GitHub, you have not given anyone interested in your project specific permission to use, modify, or reproduce your code. Default copyright laws preside in the absence of an explicit license.

### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?

I agree with the claim. An open source model places the decisions in a project among a large group of people, which allows them to make a better informed decision. This was especially true with a project such as the early internet, where having many people work on the project as open source would enhance its development.

### Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

GPL v2 is the license chosen for Linux. This is likely because the source code of Linux and any distrubitions made using Linux need to be available for anyone to see and modify. For example, one person cannot create a Linux distribution and keep it closed source - this would be against their core model of keeping software open source.
