### Image 2: Sweater (Shirt)

![](check3/sweater.jpg)

Result: Despite there being no label for Sweater, the model correctly identified this as a shirt, which is what I was hoping.

### Image 3: Boot

Result: This was the only one the model did not correctly identify. The expectation would be for the label 'Ankle boot' or even 'Sneaker', but not terrible results overall.
